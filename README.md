Using the IBM Cloud NLU service and IBM Cloud pipeline, it is possible to quickly and easily analyze movie reviews to determine sentiment and identify key entities and concepts. This can provide valuable insights for movie studios and reviewers. With pipeline, the deployment process is automated and streamlined, making it easy to manage different environments, and rollback if necessary.
